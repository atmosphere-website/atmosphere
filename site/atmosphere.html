    <h2>What is the Atmosphere</h2> <!-- Topic Header -->
    <p>
      Our atmosphere is a layer of gases that surround our earth. Nitrogen and oxygen contribute to 99% of that. That last 1% goes to argon, carbon dioxide, helium, neon, and other such gases. Water vapor and dust also contribute to our atmospheres structure.

    <p>
      Our atmosphere was presumed to be created back in the historic times when volcanoes would erupt and release their gases up and out, forming our atmosphere. Plants, which formed later on due to the creation of organisms and bacteria, began to release oxygen out into their atmosphere, creating oxygen on the planet.

      The atmosphere's weight is around that of water that is 10 metres deep.  And its layered structure from ground up contains:   troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. Another layer, called the ionosphere, extends from the mesosphere up to the  exosphere. And once the exosphere ends we have outer space. The distance between our atmosphere's layers are not determined, for the change depending on time of year and climate.

    <h2>What does the Atmosphere do for Us?</h2>
    <p>
      The layers of the atmosphere are able to reflect the sun's ultraviolet rays back into space while absorbing the heat that we need. All the while it is protecting us from radiation, ultraviolet rays and damaging heat.

    <h2>What is wrong with the Atmosphere?</h2>
    <p>
      We, humans, are releasing way too much CO2 into our atmosphere. This is causing our atmosphere to heat up by uncontrolled methods , making oceans, land and environments rise significantly in temperature. Animals are more prone to extinction or extirpation due to their inability to adapt to their changing climate. Not only that, but new pests and diseases could arise, affecting not only our animals but us as well. From the way the food chain works down to webnets structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      With more CO2 in the air, sun rays begin to be absorbed instead of released, it also affects sour air quality and, if we continue this way, our future as well.
