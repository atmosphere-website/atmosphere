    <h2>What is Climate Change</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change is a change is the climate of the planet. The climate has always fluctuated
        throughout history, between ice ages to what we have today. Ecosystems have always
        been able to adapt to the changes in the climate, because the change happened over
        a long time.

    <h2>The Problem</h1>
      <p>
        If the climate continues to change at this speed, the sea level will rise because of
        melting ice in the arctic and the temperature around the world will increase
        significantly. The weather in places will become more extreme, and storms will
        become more violent. As the world gets hotter, ecosystems will become dryer, and there will be more wildfires. There are already more forest fires all over the world, namely Australia, California and British Columbia. The smoke from the wildfires will trap more heat in the atmosphere, heating the climate more and creating a dangerous <a href="feedback.html">feedback loop</a>.

      To change the direction of climate change, everybody will need to do their part. The most important thing to do is to convince people to start doing their part. We can all help by reducing what we use, and recycling and composting what we can. You can walk or bike instead of driving, and use public transit. Not doing anything is doing the wrong thing, because there is not enough time left to wait for something to happen. If you don't save the Earth now, there wont be an Earth for you later.
